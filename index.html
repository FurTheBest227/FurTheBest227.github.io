            <h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
            <p class="id">My name is Furqan Ahmed, and I live in NYC. I am a rising junior in high school. Growing up, I used tech a lot but never did much coding. Starting in high school, I began coding and realized this is what I want to do in the future. I have many goals, but my short-term goal is to learn as many coding languages as I can, and my long-term goal is to attend a good college.</p>
            <h1 class="about">About Pre-Algia</h1>
            <p class="id">The vision for Pre-Algia is to make it similar to pawn shops, but as a website where you can buy, sell, or trade rare items. You can communicate 1-on-1 online and make the best purchase with other people and the staff at Pre-Algia. We always strive to ensure fairness, and if you ever need guidance when making a trade or purchase, we can help assess if it's fair for both parties.</p>
