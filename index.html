            <h1 class ="about"> About Me</h1>
            <h3 class = "id"> My name is Furqan Ahmed, and I live in NYC, I am a rising junior in High School. Growing up, I used tech a lot but never did a lot of coding, but starting high school, I started to code and I knew that this is what i’m going to do in the future. I have lots of goals but my short-term goal is to learn as many coding languages as I can, and my long- term is to go to a good college.</h3>
            <h1 class ="about"> About Pre-Algia </h1>
            <h3 class = "id"> The vision for Pre-Algia was to make it similar to pawn shops, but we wanted to make it as a website. Where you can buy, sell, or trade rare items. You can talk 1 on 1 online, and make the best purchase with other people and the people working at Pre-Algia. We will always try to make sure everything goes fair and if you ever need our guidance when making a trade/purchase we can see if it’s fair for both of you.</h3>
